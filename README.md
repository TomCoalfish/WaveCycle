# WaveCycle
Wave + Resampler

# Like a Grain
* it is like a grain except it is only a  single wave cycle like a wave table
* but there are no tables it is resampled

# Cycle Delay
* It is a delay except the units are wavecycles

# Wave Delay
* a delay line that is also sampled like a wavetable
* the cycle is continously changing in the delay line with feedback
* like a modulated delay line but the delay can be sampled and held to create a single wave cycle table
